Ludum Dare is a free event operated by Mike and his team at [Interactive Snacks](https://interactivesnacks.com). If you like what we do and want to support us, see below.


## I want to help out
If you want to help as developer, you can find our source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/LudumDare). There you can either contribute to our knowledge base (frequently asked questions, rules, etc), or the custom software we use to run events.

Alternatively, helping answer questions posted to [ldjam.com](https://ldjam.com), to social media, or one of the many chat rooms is greatly appreciated. Our team is small, and we can't do it without your help!
