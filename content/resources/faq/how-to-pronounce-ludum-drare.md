## Etymology

Latin


## The era approach

Mike, co-creator and caretaker of Ludum Dare says you should pick whichever pronunciation resonates with you. He personally takes an era approach. He considers Ludum Dare before he was responsible to be the _Loodum Dahray_ era (i.e. before LD10), and everything after to be the _Loodum Dare_ era.
