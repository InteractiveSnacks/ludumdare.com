In 2017, Ludum Dare began running events on `ldjam.com`, previously `ludumdare.com/compo`.

The `ludumdare.com/compo` website was built on WordPress. With a quarter million users (many spammers), we had reached and pushed well beyond the limit of what could be done with WordPress. In 2015, Mike began working a replacement, built entirely from the ground up. The website soft-launched in 2016, and officially started running events in 2017.

The plan is to move all event, game, and blog content from the old (`ludumdare.com/compo`) website to the new (`ldjam.com`).

**NEW**: Migration is tentatively scheduled for late 2022/early 2023.
