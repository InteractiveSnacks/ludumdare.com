These (`index.md`) are the rules for Ludum Dare events.

We have a second document ["Best Practices"](../best-practices/) that compliments the rules with recommendations and general advice.

If you'd like to contribute more specific advice, consider contributing to our education project, the [Jammer Academy](https://github.com/JammerAcademy).

The legacy rules can be found [in the archive](../archive/).
