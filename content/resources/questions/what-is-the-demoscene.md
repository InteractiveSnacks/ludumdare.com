The Demoscene is a computer art subculture focused on creating "demos": non-interactive audiovisual computer programs.

Demoscene events or "parties" often run one or more competitive events or ["compos"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-game-compo). Typically these are "demo compos", but they may also include ["game compos"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-game-compo), or "wild compos".

## Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare takes much inspiration from the Demoscene.

Before the term ["game jam"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-game-jam) had caught on, Ludum Dare referred to itself as a ["game compo"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-game-compo).
