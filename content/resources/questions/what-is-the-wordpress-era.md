The WordPress era was a time from XX to XX where Ludum Dare events were run on custom software written by Phil Hassey and Mike Kasprzak. As the name suggests, this custom software were a series of plugins for the popular WordPress blogging platform.

Starting with Ludum Dare XX, events were hosted on ludumdare.com, specifically ludumdare.com/compo.
