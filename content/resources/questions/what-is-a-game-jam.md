A "game jam" is an event where games are made, similar to a [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) or [demo compo](/resources/questions/what-is-the-demoscene). The term comes from the [Indie Game Jam](/resources/questions/what-is-the-indie-game-jam).

Game jam events are often short. Most last a few days to a week. Others last hours, or up to a month. 

Historically, "game jam" was used to describe casual game creation events, like to a jam session for musicians. Ludum Dare originally referred to itself as a [game compo](/resources/questions/what-is-a-compo) to highlight that it was a competitive event.
