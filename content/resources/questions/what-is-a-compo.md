"Compo" is a [Demoscene](/resources/questions/what-is-the-demoscene/) term used to describe a competitive event or format.

## What is a game compo?
A "game compo" is a competitive event or format for games. See ["competitive game jam"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-jam/).


## Ludum Dare
Championed by [Mike Kasprzak](/resources/questions/who-is-mike-kasprzak/), Ludum Dare used to call itself a "game compo" to differentiate its competitive format from the casual format of the [Indie Game Jam](/resources/questions/what-is-the-indie-game-jam/).

In the years that followed, the term ["game jam"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-jam/) grew to include both casual and competitive formats, and "game compo" fell out of favour.

Today, Ludum Dare calls itself a ["game jam"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-game-jam).

Prior to the introduction of Ludum Dare's [Extra format](/resources/questions/what-is-the-extra-format), it would have called itself a ["competitive game jam"](/resources/questions/what-is-a-jam/).


## Compo format
Within Ludum Dare, ["The Compo"](/resources/questions/what-is-compo-format) is the name often used to describe Ludum Dare's original solo competitive format, in contrast to ["The Jam"](/resources/questions/what-is-jam-format).
