Today Ludum Dare is [run by Mike Kasprzak](/resources/questions/who-runs-ludum-dare/), but Ludum Dare is the result of many contributors.

The name "Ludum Dare" comes from the forum of the same name that [Geoff Howland](/resources/questions/who-is-geoff-howland) ran in the early 2000's.

The _true_ first Ludum Dare event&mdash;Ludum Dare 0&mdash;took place in April of 2002. Conceived by [Geoff Howland](/resources/questions/who-is-geoff-howland), it was a 24 hour competitive online event open to anyone at [ludumdare.com](/resources/questions/what-is-ludumdare-com/). It took inspiration from a casual private offline event called the Indie Game Jam. The forum and event were run on custom software written by Geoff.

Taking what they learned from Ludum Dare 0, the first 48 hour Ludum Dare event&mdash;Ludum Dare 1&mdash;was a collaboration between [Geoff Howland](/resources/questions/who-is-geoff-howland), [Mike Hommel](/resources/questions/who-is-mike-hommel), [Mike Kasprzak](/resources/questions/who-is-mike-kasprzak), and [Seth Robinson](/resources/questions/who-is-seth-robinson). Geoff hosted and ran the event on his custom software, while Mike Kasprzak wrote the rules in collaboration with the team.
