Final round day is the day roughly 48 hour before Ludum Dare begins. This is typically the Wednesday before Ludum Dare, but that could be different depending on your timezone.

Final round day is the day when the final Theme Voting round begins. Final round day is also the day when the keynote is shared with the community.
