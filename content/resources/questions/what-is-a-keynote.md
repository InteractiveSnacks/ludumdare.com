Ludum Dare keynotes are videos shared with the community to encourage and inspire. Keynotes a shared on [final round day](/resources/questions/what-is-final-round-day/).

The content of keynotes vary from event to event. Some tell stories, some teach about the event, and others are just silly and fun. 

In 2009, inspired by Apple's keynotes, Mike Hommel made a silly video welcoming everyone to Ludum Dare 15. The following year, Phil Hassey and Mike Kasprzak continued the tradition by creating their own videos. Since then, many members of the community have been invited to "keynote" Ludum Dare events.
