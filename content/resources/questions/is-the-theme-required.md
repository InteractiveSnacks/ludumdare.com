Using the theme is a recommendation, not a requirement.

Since Ludum Dare 50, you can now opt-out of the the "Theme" category.

The "Theme" category is a [fully subjective category](/resources/questions/what-is-a-category), meaning opting-out is not required.

An entry will never be [disqualified](/resources/rules/#disqualification) or removed for not using the theme, or not opting-out of the "Theme" category.
