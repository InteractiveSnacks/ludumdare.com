Ludum Dare is run by Mike and his team at [Interactive Snacks](https://interactivesnacks.com). Interactive Snacks is a small but growing company. We pay our operational costs, wages, and contractors using money collected through sponsorship.

We have a limited capacity to work with sponsors, but we would love to hear from you!

You can contact Mike at [mike@interactivesnacks.com](mailto:mike@interactivesnacks.com?subject=Sponsorship).

Sorry, we don't partner with gambling or cryptocurrency companies.
