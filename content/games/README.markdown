## Games
This section collects the "post-LD" games that got their start in a Ludum Dare event, but went on to become commercial games.

## How to add games
Each game gets its own folder.

Store screenshots in the folder, and reference them inside the `index.md` file.

Videos, if the game is available on Steam, you can link the MP4 files stored on Akamai's servers. If not, contact us.

## Platform Taxonomies
