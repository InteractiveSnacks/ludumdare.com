**_London, Ontario, Canada_**—Interactive Snacks and Intel announce a new sponsorship deal for the 49th Ludum Dare _"online game jam"_ event. The deal gives Interactive Snacks resources to grow its team, and invest in making events even better.

> _"Enabling and inspiring developers is what we do."_ said Interactive Snacks founder Mike Kasprzak. _"Intel gets that, and we are thrilled to be working with them"_

_"Game jams"_ are similar to hackathons. They are events where participants are challenged to make a game from scratch in a short period of time. 

Ludum Dare is one of the longest running _"game jam"_ events in the world. It began in 2002 as a challenge between friends, but it has grown into one of the largest events of its kind. Today Ludum Dare events see tens of thousands of participants take part, creating many thousands of original games, all online, and all in just a weekend.

Ludum Dare 49 takes place on October 1st-4th weekend.
